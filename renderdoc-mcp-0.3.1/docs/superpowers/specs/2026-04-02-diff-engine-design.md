# Diff Engine Design — renderdoc-mcp Phase 3

**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Status:** Draft
**Scope:** Dual-session capture comparison with 6 diff modes, 8 MCP tools, 6 CLI commands

---

## 1. Overview

Add a diff engine to renderdoc-mcp that compares two RenderDoc capture files (.rdc) side by side. This enables AI-assisted frame regression diagnosis: load two captures (before/after a change), identify what differs at the draw, resource, pipeline, and pixel level.

**Reference:** Adapted from rdc-cli's Python diff engine (~2,200 LOC), translated to C++17 within renderdoc-mcp's layered architecture (core → MCP → CLI → Skill).

### Goals

- Compare two captures across 6 dimensions: summary, draws, resources, passes/stats, pipeline state, framebuffer pixels
- Maintain architectural consistency with existing Phase 0–2 modules
- Support both MCP tool and CLI command interfaces
- Enable CI-friendly exit codes (0 = identical, 1 = differences, 2 = error)

### Non-Goals

- 3-way merge or diff
- Remote replay diff (future phase)
- Real-time diff during capture (snapshot-only)

---

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Approach: Core Diff Module + Independent DiffSession

**Decision:** New `DiffSession` class, fully independent from existing `Session`. Both can coexist in the same process. No modifications to existing Session code.

**Rationale:** RenderDoc supports multiple `IReplayController` instances in a single process. A separate class avoids Session responsibility bloat and keeps diff lifecycle management self-contained. This is simpler than rdc-cli's dual-daemon approach (which uses separate OS processes) because C++ can hold both controllers in-process.

### 2.2 New Files

### 2.3 Build Integration

Add to CMakeLists.txt:

- `src/mcp/tools/diff_tools.cpp` to `renderdoc-mcp-lib`
- New test executables: `test-diff-algo` (unit), `test-diff-tools` (integration)

### 2.4 ToolRegistry Changes for DiffSession Access

**Problem:** The current `ToolDef::handler` signature is `(core::Session&, const json&) → json`, and `ToolRegistry::callTool` only passes a `Session&`. Diff tools need a `DiffSession&` but have no way to receive one through the existing dispatch surface.

**Solution:** Widen the handler signature to accept an opaque context that carries both sessions. Introduce a lightweight `ToolContext` struct:

```cpp
// src/mcp/tool_registry.h  (changed lines only)

namespace renderdoc::core {
    class Session;
    class DiffSession;
}

namespace renderdoc::mcp {

struct ToolContext {
    core::Session& session;
    core::DiffSession& diffSession;
};

struct ToolDef {
    std::string name;
    std::string description;
    nlohmann::json inputSchema;
    // Handler now receives ToolContext instead of bare Session&
    std::function<nlohmann::json(ToolContext&, const nlohmann::json&)> handler;
};

class ToolRegistry {
public:
    void registerTool(ToolDef def);
    nlohmann::json getToolDefinitions() const;
    // callTool now passes ToolContext
    nlohmann::json callTool(const std::string& name,
                            ToolContext& ctx,
                            const nlohmann::json& args);
    // ...
};

} // namespace renderdoc::mcp
```

**McpServer changes:**

```cpp
// src/mcp/mcp_server.h  (changed lines only)

class McpServer {
    // ...
private:
    std::unique_ptr<core::Session> m_ownedSession;
    core::Session* m_session = nullptr;
    std::unique_ptr<core::DiffSession> m_ownedDiffSession;  // NEW
    core::DiffSession* m_diffSession = nullptr;              // NEW
    std::unique_ptr<ToolRegistry> m_ownedRegistry;
    ToolRegistry* m_registry = nullptr;
    bool m_initialized = false;
};
```

The default constructor creates and owns both `Session` and `DiffSession`. The injection constructor accepts both. `handleToolsCall` builds a `ToolContext{*m_session, *m_diffSession}` and passes it to `callTool`.

**Migration of existing tools:** All existing tool handlers change signature from `(Session& s, const json& p)` to `(ToolContext& ctx, const json& p)` and access the session via `ctx.session`. This is a mechanical find-and-replace with no behavioral change — existing tools ignore `ctx.diffSession`.

**Diff tool registration:** Diff tools access `ctx.diffSession` directly:

```cpp
void registerDiffTools(ToolRegistry& registry) {
    registry.registerTool({"diff_open", "Open two captures for comparison", schema,
        [](ToolContext& ctx, const json& params) {
            auto result = ctx.diffSession.open(params["captureA"], params["captureB"]);
            return to_json(result);
        }});
}
```

**Test injection constructor:** `McpServer(Session&, DiffSession&, ToolRegistry&)` — three-arg variant for tests that inject both sessions.

Both sessions are independently managed. Opening a diff session does NOT close the regular session, and vice versa.

---

## 3. DiffSession Class

```cpp
namespace renderdoc::core {

class DiffSession {
public:
    DiffSession();
    ~DiffSession();  // calls close()

    DiffSession(const DiffSession&) = delete;
    DiffSession& operator=(const DiffSession&) = delete;

    struct OpenResult {
        CaptureInfo infoA;
        CaptureInfo infoB;
    };

    // Opens both captures. Throws CoreError on failure.
    // If already open, throws DiffAlreadyOpen.
    OpenResult open(const std::string& pathA, const std::string& pathB);

    // Closes both sessions. Safe to call multiple times.
    void close();

    bool isOpen() const;

    // Internal accessors for diff algorithms
    IReplayController* controllerA() const;
    IReplayController* controllerB() const;
    ICaptureFile* captureFileA() const;
    ICaptureFile* captureFileB() const;
    const std::string& pathA() const;
    const std::string& pathB() const;

private:
    ICaptureFile* m_capA = nullptr;
    ICaptureFile* m_capB = nullptr;
    IReplayController* m_ctrlA = nullptr;
    IReplayController* m_ctrlB = nullptr;
    std::string m_pathA, m_pathB;
};

} // namespace renderdoc::core
```

### Lifecycle

1. **open(pathA, pathB):**
   - Create two `ICaptureFile` instances via `RENDERDOC_OpenCaptureFile`
   - Open replay on each: `cap->OpenCapture(ReplayOptions(), &controller)`
   - If A succeeds but B fails: close A, then throw
   - Store both controllers and paths
   - Return `OpenResult` with metadata from both captures

2. **close():**
   - Shutdown controllers (if non-null): `controller->Shutdown()`
   - Shutdown capture files: `cap->Shutdown()`
   - Null all pointers

3. **Destructor:** Calls `close()`.

## 4. Data Types

All new types in `src/core/diff.h` within `namespace renderdoc::core`:

### 4.1 Common

```cpp
enum class DiffStatus { Equal, Modified, Added, Deleted };
```

### 4.2 Draw Alignment

```cpp
struct DrawRecord {
    uint32_t eventId = 0;
    std::string drawType;      // "Draw", "DrawIndexed", "Dispatch", "Clear", "Copy"
    std::string markerPath;    // hierarchical marker path, empty if none
    uint64_t triangles = 0;    // (numIndices / 3) * numInstances
    uint32_t instances = 0;
    std::string passName;
    std::string shaderHash;    // fallback matching key
    std::string topology;      // "TriangleList", "TriangleStrip", etc.
};

struct DrawDiffRow {
    DiffStatus status = DiffStatus::Equal;
    std::optional<DrawRecord> a;
    std::optional<DrawRecord> b;
    std::string confidence;    // "high", "medium", "low"
};

struct DrawsDiffResult {
    std::vector<DrawDiffRow> rows;
    int added = 0, deleted = 0, modified = 0, unchanged = 0;
};
```

### 4.3 Resources

```cpp
struct ResourceDiffRow {
    DiffStatus status = DiffStatus::Equal;
    std::string name;
    std::string typeA, typeB;
    std::string confidence;    // "high" (named) or "low" (unnamed positional)
};

struct ResourcesDiffResult {
    std::vector<ResourceDiffRow> rows;
    int added = 0, deleted = 0, modified = 0, unchanged = 0;
};
```

### 4.4 Stats / Passes

```cpp
struct PassDiffRow {
    DiffStatus status = DiffStatus::Equal;
    std::string name;
    std::optional<uint32_t> drawsA, drawsB;
    std::optional<uint64_t> trianglesA, trianglesB;
    std::optional<uint32_t> dispatchesA, dispatchesB;
};

struct StatsDiffResult {
    std::vector<PassDiffRow> rows;
    int passesChanged = 0, passesAdded = 0, passesDeleted = 0;
    int64_t drawsDelta = 0, trianglesDelta = 0, dispatchesDelta = 0;
};
```

### 4.5 Pipeline

```cpp
struct PipeFieldDiff {
    std::string section;    // "blend", "viewport", "rasterizer", etc.
    std::string field;      // "cullMode" or "blends[0].srcBlend"
    std::string valueA;     // stringified
    std::string valueB;
    bool changed = false;
};

struct PipelineDiffResult {
    uint32_t eidA = 0, eidB = 0;
    std::string markerPath;
    std::vector<PipeFieldDiff> fields;
    int changedCount = 0, totalCount = 0;
};
```

### 4.6 Framebuffer

Reuses existing `ImageCompareResult` from types.h:

```cpp
struct ImageCompareResult {
    bool pass = false;
    int diffPixels = 0;
    int totalPixels = 0;
    double diffRatio = 0.0;
    std::string diffOutputPath;
    std::string message;
};
```

### 4.7 Summary

```cpp
struct SummaryRow {
    std::string category;   // "draws", "passes", "resources", "events"
    int valueA = 0, valueB = 0;
    int delta = 0;
};

struct SummaryDiffResult {
    std::vector<SummaryRow> rows;
    bool identical = false;
    std::string divergedAt;  // "" if identical, else "counts", "structure", or "framebuffer"
};
```

---

## 5. Diff Algorithms

### 5.1 Function Signatures

```cpp
namespace renderdoc::core {

SummaryDiffResult    diffSummary(DiffSession& session);
DrawsDiffResult      diffDraws(DiffSession& session);
ResourcesDiffResult  diffResources(DiffSession& session);
StatsDiffResult      diffStats(DiffSession& session);
PipelineDiffResult   diffPipeline(DiffSession& session, const std::string& markerPath);
ImageCompareResult   diffFramebuffer(DiffSession& session,
                                      uint32_t eidA = 0, uint32_t eidB = 0,
                                      int target = 0,
                                      double threshold = 0.0,
                                      const std::string& diffOutput = "");

// Internal: LCS alignment (exposed for unit testing)
using AlignedPair = std::pair<std::optional<size_t>, std::optional<size_t>>;
std::vector<AlignedPair> lcsAlign(const std::vector<std::string>& keysA,
                                   const std::vector<std::string>& keysB);
}
```

### 5.2 LCS Draw Alignment Algorithm

**Match key generation:**

The key must be **position-independent** so that inserting or removing a draw earlier in the sequence does not cascade key shifts across all subsequent draws.

1. **Marker mode** (when any draw has a non-empty markerPath):
   - Key = `markerPath + "|" + drawType`
   - This means two draws with the same (markerPath, drawType) produce **identical keys**
   - LCS handles duplicate keys correctly: duplicate keys in the same sequence simply produce multiple candidate matches, and the DP table picks the optimal alignment that maximizes total matches. This is how text-diff tools handle repeated lines.
   - **Why not sequentialIndex?** Including a per-side positional counter in the key defeats LCS: if a draw of the same type is inserted before existing draws in one capture, all downstream counters shift and the algorithm sees them as entirely different keys, reporting a cascade of false modifications instead of one localized insertion.

2. **Fallback mode** (all markers empty):
   - Key = `drawType + "|" + shaderHash + "|" + topology`
   - shaderHash provides content-based identity independent of position
   - Duplicate keys handled the same way as marker mode

**LCS core:**
- Standard O(n*m) dynamic programming where n, m are the key sequence lengths
- Backtrack from bottom-right to build matched pairs
- Unmatched items interleaved as Added/Deleted
- Duplicate keys: LCS naturally handles repeated elements — the DP finds the longest common subsequence even when keys repeat, preferring to match elements in order without requiring uniqueness

**Performance optimization:**
- When total draws > 500 AND markers present: group by top-level marker (first path segment), run LCS per group independently, concatenate results. This preserves correctness because top-level markers partition draws into independent blocks.

**Status classification:**
- `Equal`: drawType + triangles + instances all match
- `Modified`: aligned but any field differs
- `Added`: present only in B
- `Deleted`: present only in A

**Confidence:**
- Marker mode with unique key: `"high"`
- Marker mode with duplicate keys (ambiguous match): `"medium"` — the alignment is optimal but the specific pairing among duplicates is arbitrary
- Fallback mode: `"medium"` if shaderHash is unique, `"low"` if duplicated

### 5.3 Resource Matching

1. **Named resources** (name non-empty): match by `lowercase(name)`, first occurrence only
2. **Unnamed resources**: group by type, match by positional index within group
3. Named matches = "high" confidence, unnamed = "low"

### 5.4 Stats / Passes Matching

- Match passes by `lowercase(strip(name))`
- Compare three metrics: draws, triangles, dispatches
- Equal = all three match, Modified = any differs

### 5.5 Pipeline Comparison

1. Use `diffDraws()` to align draws
2. Find the aligned pair matching the requested `markerPath` (supports `[N]` index syntax)
3. Navigate to respective EIDs on both controllers
4. Extract pipeline state from both controllers via existing `getPipelineState()` core function
5. Compare sections using the fields available in our `PipelineState` struct:
   - **Shaders**: compare bound shader IDs and entry points per stage
   - **Render targets**: compare RT count, formats, dimensions
   - **Depth target**: compare depth target binding
   - **Viewports**: compare viewport dimensions and depth ranges
   - Additionally, query per-API state objects (D3D11Pipe, D3D12Pipe, GLPipe, VKPipe) from RenderDoc's `GetPipelineState()` for extended fields: topology, rasterizer, blend, depth/stencil, MSAA
   - **Flat fields** (topology, rasterizer, depth_stencil, msaa): field-by-field
   - **List fields** (blend states, viewports): element-by-element, then sub-fields
   - **Nested fields** (stencil front/back): recursive field comparison
6. All values stringified for comparison
7. Note: Available pipeline sections depend on the graphics API. Fields not available for a given API are omitted.

### 5.6 Framebuffer Comparison

1. If eidA/eidB == 0, find last draw event in each capture
2. Navigate both controllers to respective EIDs
3. Export render target at specified target index from both controllers to temp PNGs
4. Reuse existing `compareImages()` from assertions module (stb_image based)
5. Return `ImageCompareResult` with diffPixels, diffRatio, optional diff image

### 5.7 Summary

`diffSummary` performs a **multi-level check**, not just count comparison:

**Level 1 — Counts** (cheap, always run):
- `draws`: total draw calls
- `passes`: number of render passes
- `resources`: total GPU resource count
- `events`: total event count

If any count differs, `identical = false` immediately (no further checks needed).

**Level 2 — Structural** (run only when all counts match):
- Run `diffDraws()` and check for any `Modified` rows (same count but different triangles/instances/type)
- Run `diffResources()` and check for any `Modified` rows (same count but type changed)

If any structural difference found, `identical = false`.

**Level 3 — Framebuffer spot-check** (run only when structure is identical):
- Run `diffFramebuffer()` at the last draw event with threshold=0
- If `diffPixels > 0`, `identical = false`

This ensures summary mode catches pipeline state and pixel-level regressions that don't change counts. The `identical` flag is only `true` when all three levels pass.

**Performance note:** Level 2 and 3 add cost. For the CLI `--summary` mode this is acceptable since it's the default quick-check. The `SummaryDiffResult` includes a `depth` field indicating which level detected the difference:

```cpp
struct SummaryDiffResult {
    std::vector<SummaryRow> rows;
    bool identical = false;
    std::string divergedAt;  // "" if identical, else "counts", "structure", or "framebuffer"
};
```

This tells the caller (and AI) where to drill deeper: if `divergedAt == "framebuffer"`, skip straight to `diff_framebuffer` rather than `diff_draws`.

## 9. JSON Serialization

Extend `src/mcp/serialization.h/cpp` with `to_json` for all new types:

- `DiffStatus` → `"equal"`, `"modified"`, `"added"`, `"deleted"`
- `DrawRecord` → object with all fields
- `DrawDiffRow` → `{ status, a?, b?, confidence }`
- `DrawsDiffResult` → `{ rows, added, deleted, modified, unchanged }`
- `ResourceDiffRow` → `{ status, name, typeA, typeB, confidence }`
- `ResourcesDiffResult` → `{ rows, added, deleted, modified, unchanged }`
- `PassDiffRow` → `{ status, name, drawsA?, drawsB?, trianglesA?, trianglesB?, dispatchesA?, dispatchesB? }`
- `StatsDiffResult` → `{ rows, passesChanged, passesAdded, passesDeleted, drawsDelta, trianglesDelta, dispatchesDelta }`
- `PipeFieldDiff` → `{ section, field, valueA, valueB, changed }`
- `PipelineDiffResult` → `{ eidA, eidB, markerPath, fields, changedCount, totalCount }`
- `SummaryRow` → `{ category, valueA, valueB, delta }`
- `SummaryDiffResult` → `{ rows, identical, divergedAt }`
- `DiffSession::OpenResult` → `{ infoA: CaptureInfo, infoB: CaptureInfo }`

## 10. Testing

### 10.1 Unit Tests (`test-diff-algo`)

No RenderDoc dependency. Tests the LCS algorithm and match key generation:

- **LCS basic cases:** identical sequences, completely different, single element, empty
- **LCS with markers:** marker-based key generation, position-independent matching
- **LCS duplicate keys:** repeated (markerPath, drawType) pairs aligned correctly; insertion of one duplicate localizes to a single Added row without cascading shifts
- **LCS fallback:** shader hash + topology matching when no markers
- **LCS performance:** large sequences (500+ draws) with group optimization
- **Match key edge cases:** empty markers, duplicate markers, special characters
- **Confidence levels:** high/medium/low assigned correctly based on key uniqueness

### 10.2 Integration Tests (`test-diff-tools`)

Requires RenderDoc + test fixture:

- **Self-diff (vkcube.rdc vs vkcube.rdc):**
  - `diff_open` succeeds, returns matching CaptureInfo
  - `diff_summary` returns `identical = true`
  - `diff_draws` returns all `Equal` rows
  - `diff_resources` returns all `Equal` rows
  - `diff_stats` returns all `Equal` rows
  - `diff_pipeline` with valid marker returns `changedCount = 0`
  - `diff_framebuffer` returns `diffPixels = 0`
  - `diff_close` succeeds

- **Error handling:**
  - `diff_draws` before `diff_open` → DiffNotOpen error
  - `diff_open` with nonexistent file → FileNotFound error
  - `diff_open` twice → DiffAlreadyOpen error
  - `diff_pipeline` with invalid marker → MarkerNotFound error

### 10.3 Protocol Test Update

Update `test_protocol.cpp` tool count from 40 to 48.

## 11. Skill Update

Add to `skills/renderdoc-mcp/SKILL.md`:

### New Workflow: Frame Regression Diagnosis

```
When comparing two captures to find rendering differences:
1. diff_open captureA captureB          → Load both captures
2. diff_summary                          → Quick overview: any differences?
3. diff_draws                            → Which draws changed/added/removed?
4. diff_pipeline "MarkerPath"            → What pipeline state changed at that draw?
5. diff_framebuffer --diff-output path   → Pixel-level visual comparison
6. diff_close                            → Clean up
```

### Tool Reference Additions

Document all 8 new diff tools with parameter descriptions and example outputs.

## 12. Implementation Order

Suggested implementation sequence:

1. **Types + DiffSession** — diff.h types, diff_session.h/cpp
2. **LCS algorithm** — lcsAlign() + unit tests
3. **Core diff functions** — diffSummary, diffDraws, diffResources, diffStats, diffPipeline, diffFramebuffer
4. **Serialization** — to_json for all diff types
5. **MCP tools** — 8 tool registrations in diff_tools.cpp
6. **CLI commands** — diff subcommand in main.cpp
7. **Integration tests** — self-diff + error cases
8. **Skill update** — SKILL.md + README
